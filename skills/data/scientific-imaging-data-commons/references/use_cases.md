# Common Use Cases for IDC

**Tested with:** idc-index 0.11.9 (IDC data version v23)

This guide provides complete end-to-end workflow examples for common IDC use cases. Each use case demonstrates the full workflow from query to download with best practices.

## When to Use This Guide

Load this guide when you need:
- Complete end-to-end workflow examples for training dataset creation
- Patterns for multi-step data selection and download workflows
- Examples of license-aware data handling for commercial use
- Visualization workflows for data preview before download

For core API patterns (query, download, visualize, citations), see the "Core Capabilities" section in the main SKILL.md.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install --upgrade idc-index
```

## Use Case 1: Find and Download Lung CT Scans for Deep Learning

**Objective:** Build training dataset of lung CT scans from NLST collection

**Steps:**
```python
from idc_index import IDCClient

client = IDCClient()

# 1. Query for lung CT scans with specific criteria
query = """
SELECT
  PatientID,
  SeriesInstanceUID,
  SeriesDescription
FROM index
WHERE collection_id = 'nlst'
  AND Modality = 'CT'
  AND BodyPartExamined = 'CHEST'
  AND license_short_name = 'CC BY 4.0'
ORDER BY PatientID
LIMIT 100
"""

results = client.sql_query(query)
print(f"Found {len(results)} series from {results['PatientID'].nunique()} patients")

# 2. Download data organized by patient
client.download_from_selection(
    seriesInstanceUID=list(results['SeriesInstanceUID'].values),
    downloadDir="./training_data",
    dirTemplate="%collection_id/%PatientID/%SeriesInstanceUID"
)

# 3. Save manifest for reproducibility
results.to_csv('training_manifest.csv', index=False)
```

## Use Case 2: Query Brain MRI by Manufacturer for Quality Study

**Objective:** Compare image quality across different MRI scanner manufacturers

**Steps:**
```python
from idc_index import IDCClient
import pandas as pd

client = IDCClient()

# Query for brain MRI grouped by manufacturer
query = """
SELECT
  Manufacturer,
  ManufacturerModelName,
  COUNT(DISTINCT SeriesInstanceUID) as num_series,
  COUNT(DISTINCT PatientID) as num_patients
FROM index
WHERE Modality = 'MR'
  AND BodyPartExamined LIKE '%BRAIN%'
GROUP BY Manufacturer, ManufacturerModelName
HAVING num_series >= 10
ORDER BY num_series DESC
"""

manufacturers = client.sql_query(query)
print(manufacturers)

# Download sample from each manufacturer for comparison
for _, row in manufacturers.head(3).iterrows():
    mfr = row['Manufacturer']
    model = row['ManufacturerModelName']

    query = f"""
    SELECT SeriesInstanceUID
    FROM index
    WHERE Manufacturer = '{mfr}'
      AND ManufacturerModelName = '{model}'
      AND Modality = 'MR'
      AND BodyPartExamined LIKE '%BRAIN%'
    LIMIT 5
    """

    series = client.sql_query(query)
    client.download_from_selection(
        seriesInstanceUID=list(series['SeriesInstanceUID'].values),
        downloadDir=f"./quality_study/{mfr.replace(' ', '_')}"
    )
```

## Use Case 3: Visualize Series Without Downloading

**Objective:** Preview imaging data before committing to download

```python
from idc_index import IDCClient
import webbrowser

client = IDCClient()

series_list = client.sql_query("""
    SELECT SeriesInstanceUID, PatientID, SeriesDescription
    FROM index
    WHERE collection_id = 'acrin_nsclc_fdg_pet' AND Modality = 'PT'
    LIMIT 10
""")

# Preview each in browser
for _, row in series_list.iterrows():
    viewer_url = client.get_viewer_URL(seriesInstanceUID=row['SeriesInstanceUID'])
    print(f"Patient {row['PatientID']}: {row['SeriesDescription']}")
    print(f"  View at: {viewer_url}")
    # webbrowser.open(viewer_url)  # Uncomment to open automatically
```

## Use Case 4: License-Aware Batch Download for Commercial Use

**Objective:** Download only CC-BY licensed data suitable for commercial applications

**Steps:**
```python
from idc_index import IDCClient

client = IDCClient()

# Query ONLY for CC BY licensed data (allows commercial use with attribution)
query = """
SELECT
  SeriesInstanceUID,
  collection_id,
  PatientID,
  Modality
FROM index
WHERE license_short_name LIKE 'CC BY%'
  AND license_short_name NOT LIKE '%NC%'
  AND Modality IN ('CT', 'MR')
  AND BodyPartExamined IN ('CHEST', 'BRAIN', 'ABDOMEN')
LIMIT 200
"""

cc_by_data = client.sql_query(query)

print(f"Found {len(cc_by_data)} CC BY licensed series")
print(f"Collections: {cc_by_data['collection_id'].unique()}")

# Download with license verification
client.download_from_selection(
    seriesInstanceUID=list(cc_by_data['SeriesInstanceUID'].values),
    downloadDir="./commercial_dataset",
    dirTemplate="%collection_id/%Modality/%PatientID/%SeriesInstanceUID"
)

# Save license information
cc_by_data.to_csv('commercial_dataset_manifest_CC-BY_ONLY.csv', index=False)
```
